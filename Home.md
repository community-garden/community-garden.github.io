Welcome to the community-garden.github.io wiki!

# Pergola

The 2020th 8th round of the prototype fund brought up this group of people, engaged into the
creation of a tool for managing and organizing a community garden. We are a group  of
people already being involved in urban gardening projects and want to use our knowledge about
the challenges around maintaining an open community of volunteers and passionate gardeners to create a beautiful place.

Our mission is to make it easier for those groups and cooperatives to organize themselves, connect to other
initiatives or maybe start a new project from scratch with an elaborate tool on their side to fulfil the vision.


Some of out guidlines:

- open source, open data
- data transparency
- self hosting capability + SaaS
- no dependency on commercial tools or services
- but still optional interoperability with existing ones
