# Our mission

The 2020th 8th round of the prototype fund brought up this group of people, engaged into the
creation of a tool for managing and organizing a community garden. We are a group  of
people already being involved in urban gardening projects and want to use our knowledge about
the challenges around maintaining an open community of volunteers and passionate gardeners to create a beautiful place.

Our mission is to make it easier for those groups and cooperatives to organize themselves, connect to other
initiatives or maybe start a new project from scratch with an elaborate tool on their side to fulfil the vision.

# Pergola

Our main application is called _Pergola_. A hybrid App, which can be build for various platforms and has a lightweight
backend.

# Some of our guidelines

- open source, open data
- data transparency
- self hosting capability + SaaS
- no dependency on commercial tools or services
- but still optional interoperability with existing ones
