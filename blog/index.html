About Pergola\\n\\nWe knew it from the very beginning: what we need for our app, is a cool name people keep in their heads. It should work in english as well, let images arise and, of course, have something to do with plants, nature, community.\\n\\nOne day, enlightenment hit us suddenly - during one of our team members illness. Poor Philipp had to stay in bed, sleep a lot, and was barely able to stare at his phone screen through glassy eyes. Did it happen in a dream, or in a kind-of-aware state of mind? We will never know. After he got better after a couple of days, he proudly presented a little selection of his best delirium ideas. It only took us a second to decide on our favorite: the pergola. You don't know that? Pergolas represent so many things we also consider as the philosophy around our application.\\n\\n> A _pergola_ is a climbing aid, something to lean on or a trellis.\\n\\nThis is what we want our app tp be for the garden community. Giving a structure that is filled by the gardeners themselves. Roses, vetches or ivy? It's up to you, gardeners!\\n\\n\\n> A _pergola_ marks a special place in the garden, typically leading somewhere.\\n\\nThis is supposed to be the spirit of our app - leading community gardeners the way and giving support. And isn't it special to have a digital support for community garden organization?\\n\\n\\n> A _pergola_ is a construction which is open at the top.\\n\\nYep, you're right, the app is an open-source project and free for all to take a look in. You decide how you use it. You inspire us to change it.\\n\\n\\n> A _pergola_ is a shaded passage and gives structure to the space.  \\n\\nThis is how we want our app to be used: save and secure, relaxing, preventing you from the heat of information we all experience nowadays.\\n\\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72280627/108992376-8813b980-7699-11eb-84bc-7332e4d3ce48.jpg)\"},{\"basename\":\"(EN)-Defining-the-problem.md\",\"title\":\"Defining-the-problem\",\"lang\":\"EN\",\"id\":-2118498974,\"body\":\"## A community gardener's life\\n\\nLets be honest: Even gardening all by yourself isn\u2018t neccessarily an easy thing to do. Now imagine a whole group of individuals trying their best to create a green, fruitful and peaceful place right in the middle of the urban desert. Yup, you guessed it, this offers the chance to become a real project. \\n\\nOf course, there is some classic community gardening going on. This includes caring about some shared spaces, planting, weeding, watering and \u2013 if everything works out as planned \u2013 harvesting. Besides, people come to share their knowledge about planting, constructing, sustainability \u2026 or sometimes just to hang out and relax. \\n\\n![questions people have when sharing a garden space](https://github.com/community-garden/community-garden.github.io/wiki/images/questions-gif.gif)\\n\\n\\n\\nThings need to be organized. Tasks need to be done. People need to communicate about it (sometimes a lot!). Plus: Everybody has a life outside of the community garden paradise, which can be quite a hustle sometimes. \\n\\nSo this is how we found our mission: With an elaborate tool on their side, we want to make it easier for those groups and cooperatives to organize themselves, connect to other initiatives or maybe even start a new project from scratch to fulfil their vision.\\n\\n## Ask your local community gardeners\\n\\nAs we revealed before, nearly everyone of our project group identifies directly with the people that should benefit from our prototype solution in the future. So of course, we brought up some inital ideas of our own! So at the beginning, there was a list of features, that would make at least a handful of gardeners really happy, e.g. a digital wating plan, an optimized tool for events and tasks to be done or even an interactive map, that uses real time sensor data and informs us about things going on in the garden.\\n\\n\\nAnyway, we considered the existing data base at that point kind of subjective. How representative could the few of us really be? How do our problems match those of other gardeners? What kind of solutions or products might be already in use to tackle those needs? \\n\\n### We set up a survey.\\n\\n![survey results](https://github.com/community-garden/community-garden.github.io/wiki/images/Umfrage___englisch_2x.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nAs we looked at those information, future users began to form in our minds and we were able to put all the existing data (and of course some images of people we know) into three personas: Jonas, Franziska und G\u00FCnther. They were now supposed to be our toughest critics in the prototype development. \\n\\n\\nWith the user data already gathered and the personas put in place, possible features began to pop up in our minds. Also earlier ideas seemed to be verified somehow. Putting all of our ideas in prototypes seemed just not managable with the existing (wo)manpower. But still, we were not able to agree on one, two or three main ideas giving us a straight guidance on creating a prototype. Using the RICE-Score now delivered us some ordinal support on our synthesis. \\n\\nThis is Franziska, our super engaged family manager.\\n\\n![Persona Franziska](https://github.com/community-garden/community-garden.github.io/wiki/images/Franziska__die_initiative_Familienmanagerin___EN_2x.png)\\n\\nThis is Jonas, our sustainability-driven university student.\\n\\n![Persona Jonas](https://github.com/community-garden/community-garden.github.io/wiki/images/Jonas__der_nachhaltige_Student___EN_2x.png)\\n\\nThis is G\u00FCnther, our passionate senior gardener.\\n\\n![Persona G\u00FCnther](https://github.com/community-garden/community-garden.github.io/wiki/images/Guenther__der_engagierte_Rentner___EN_2x.png)\\n\"},{\"basename\":\"(EN)-How-it-feels-to-turn-opinions-into-numbers.md\",\"title\":\"How-it-feels-to-turn-opinions-into-numbers\",\"lang\":\"EN\",\"id\":-600077734,\"body\":\"## How it feels to turn opinions into numbers \\n\\nAs described in the [last chapter](/blog/post/-245978162), we were facing around 20 great ideas, all of them kinda tackling our users needs and pains. Priorization strongly recommended here!\\nFirstly, we met in person. We decided to evaluate half of the ideas in a first meeting. This is how it went:\\n\\n1. We created a shared understanding of the method by presenting it briefly and discussing open questions.\\n\\n\\n2. We set up a strict timetable for the next hour to get through at least 10 ideas.\\n\\n\\n3. We started with the first idea:\\n\\n* One person pitches the idea (1\u201C)\\n* The team asks questions to concretize the idea (2\u201C)\\n* Every team member silently rates the presented idea in the dimensions reach (R), impact (I), confidence (C) and effort (E) (2\u201C)\\n* Ratings are collected in a very sophisticated excel sheet ;-) (1\u201C)\\n\\n4. We repeated step 3 as many times as time allowed.\\n\\n\\nBelieve it or not: it worked. We rated the other half of the features in a second meeting on BigBlueButton, as COVID19-restrictions forced us to. It turned out fine as well, as all of us were quite familiar with the method at that point.\\n\\n\\nAfter some juggling with the rating data, we finally had our feature ideas prioritized. It felt great!\\n\\n## The winners\\n\\nSo here they are, our four most promising features identified by using the RICE method.\\n\\n![Top Features](https://github.com/community-garden/community-garden.github.io/wiki/images/TopFeatures_EN___1_2x.png)\\n\\n### 1. The Watering Plan\\n\\nA digital, interactive watering plan helps gardeners to faily and fexibly distribute their commitment in watering. Works much better than a spreadsheet.\\n\\n### 2. Garden Planner\\n\\nWorkshops and other exciting events at the garden become visible to the public. Exports into your personal calendar and manages attendees as well.\\n\\n### 3. What\u2018s up?\\n\\nOn a customizable dashboard, every gardener sees exactly what he or she needs to see. Combines content from other features and applications to one snackable page.\\n\\n### 4. Harvest me!\\n\\nHow to share a garden\u2018s crop is organized in this feature. Gives some sustainability to the community harvesting and helps those who don\u2018t dare to participate.\\n\"}]},\"path\":\"blog\",\"sharedData\":{},\"siteData\":{}}");</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/vendors~__react_static_root__/src/containers/Markdown~__react_static_root__/src/containers/Post~__re~3b5474e7.b07045d6.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/__react_static_root__/src/pages/blog.tsx.8b144bad.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/styles.7839fdb1.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/vendors~main.36486471.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/main.b88f1282.js"></script></body></html>
