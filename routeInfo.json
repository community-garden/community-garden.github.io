We are a group  of people already being involved in urban gardening projects and want to use our knowledge about the challenges around maintaining an open community of volunteers and passionate gardeners to create a beautiful place.\n\nOur mission is to make it easier for those groups and cooperatives to organize themselves, connect to other initiatives or maybe start a new project from scratch with an elaborate tool on their side to fulfil the vision.\n\n# Pergola\n\nOur main application is called _Pergola_. A hybrid app, which can be build for various platforms and has a lightweight\nbackend. See our [demo](https://live.pergola.gra.one/) and give us some [feedback](https://stephho.typeform.com/to/eTiWosV0) on it! We'd love to hear what you think ðŸ¤© \n\n# Some of our guidelines\n\n- open source, open data\n- data transparency\n- self hosting capability + SaaS\n- no dependency on commercial tools or services\n- but still optional interoperability with existing ones\n\n"},"path":"/"}
